This is not an obsidian vault as it doesn't include a `.obsidian` directory. This was excluded as you should create your own vault so that Obsidian can generate a unique workspace id for you.

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Download Obsidian

head to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and click the download button. Then install and open the app.

## Step 2: Create a Vault

1. Pick a folder destination where you'd like your vaults to live (I put mine in `~/Vaults/`)
2. Create a name for your Workiva vault (I named mine `w-brain`)

## Step 3: "Import" this vault into yours

1. Copy and Paste all folders and files from this vault into your own vault
2. (Optional) Install list of recommended plugins
3. Profit
